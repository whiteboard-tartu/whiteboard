Introduction
============

Currently, teachers who manage online classes use several tools with different purposes. For example, they can use one application for distributing content (mailing lists, custom websites), one application for quizzes and homework submission, one application to manage gradebooks, another for classroom discussion (forums, webconferencing or chat), and several others. Our aim is to consolidate the necessary functionality into one standalone solution while keeping it lightweight, easy to deploy & use, and also make it easy to add new functionality.
